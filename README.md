 Free Code Camp Personal Portfolio Website Project


In this Free Code Camp Project I built a simple personal developer portfolio website. 

This project was the last project required to earn the certificate for the 300 hour course on responsive web design. 

During this project in incorperated much of what I had learnt from the previous projects I completed whilst being enrolled in this course.

Some features I would like to change;

- Update the website with my real project.
- Add javascript to make the website more interactive.
- Change styles.
- update social media links to allow visitors to be redirected to my social media profiles.
- add more pages to the website to showcase my skills, abilities and all projects.
